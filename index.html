                Hi,<br>

                Greetings, I'm MD Shafayat Islam from Bangladesh. Currently, I'm doing my Bachelor's degree in
                Mathematics at Rajshahi college and mastering web development skills. <br>

                SEO is something that I love experimenting with. It's really exciting to rank a totally new site to the
                first page among millions. <br>

                Besides, I love learning new things. It's like an adventure to me. I believe learning something new
                always develops one. I want to develop my society by developing ownself.

                Because I believe we are the society together and this"I/myself" is the element what can we change to
                bring change in society.</p>
